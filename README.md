# CLI Oh My!

A repo that is part notes and part sandbox that aims to help us level up our command line skills. I'm going to be picking topics as they interest me and perdiodically refactor so that it hopefully makes some cohesive sense.

## Getting started

I've included a docker container that should contain everything that we need.

```shell
# build the image
docker build -t cli-oh-my .

# run the image
docker run -it cli-oh-my
```

## Notes

The notes can be found in [notes.md](./notes.md)
